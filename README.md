# power-is-in-the-people


The sales pitch: 

1. In United States of America, power is in the people. 

2. Elected officials vote on bills as representatives of the people they serve. 

3. If the elected officials do not accurately represent the people and their needs, then people can not elect them again in the next election. 

4. PROBLEM STATEMENT: Currently, steps 1-3 are not executed most efficiently and accurately because of lack of clear communication between the elected officials and their constituents. 
  - Elected officials often do not know the constituents' needs clearly. 
  - A constituent can write in the effort to communicate to the elected officials, but elected officials often ignore if it's coming from the voice of one person. Joining a Political Action Committee (PAC) or organizing a protest is one way to make your voice heard, but this effort is time-consuming and difficult.
  - It is difficult for constituents to keep track of all the elected official's policy decisions and decide whether they have successfully represented your needs. 
  
5. SOLUTION STATEMENT: [ Power Is In The People ] will let people vote on specific bills as they go through the legislation process. Each constituents' votes will be collected and reported to elected officials as their district's stance to individual bills before they can make their decision and cast their vote. It will be communicated to them clearly that some constituents have voted HARD NO, which means that the constituent has committed to not voting for them again in the next election if the elected official's vote doesn't match theirs. [ Power Is In The People ] will notify the constituent before the election and remind them of this committment. 

More Attributes/Other Idea: 

1. [ Power Is In the People ] is integrated with Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Youtube, and other social platforms. Posts will be made regularly of upcoming bills, with a simple and convenient link attached where people can cast their vote. 

2. Initial go-live will be at federal-level only. State legislative process can be added in the future. 

3. The elected officials will have [ sponsored by ] tag next to their name listing out their biggest donors.
